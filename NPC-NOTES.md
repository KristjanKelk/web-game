## NPC

### Rough plan recap:

- level 1 random movement
- level 2 - goes after resources, but does not understand the value of the differences and does not know how to slide from walls - goes by shortest path
- level 3 - SHould understand optimal movement and "bouncing" + changes direction if better resource + centers itself when got 1 for probability.
